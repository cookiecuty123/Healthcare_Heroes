# Healthcare Heroes

This is the game Healthcare Heroes. The game is intended to be embeded in the website FunyAble for easy acess to every users.

## Description

The game consists of a doctor that has to kill incoming COVID-19 viruses by using a newly devolpped vaccine. The goal is to kill a prescribed amount of viruses (20) to win the game. Players have three lives and may otherwise die if they get infected by the virus.

## Purpose

We thought about accompanying our website with a game to make the atmosphere even more fun and to alleviate the weight of the COVID-19 out break by allowing people to laugh about it and to have a good time at home, on their own.
